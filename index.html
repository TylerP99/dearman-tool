        <h1>What is D.E.A.R. M.A.N.?</h1>

        <p>D.E.A.R. M.A.N. is a skill coming from Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, or DBT. It is used to have a more successful interaction with someone when asking for something or saying no to something. D.E.A.R. M.A.N. is an acronym used for remembering the steps in this process. It breaks down into:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>D</strong>escribe</li>
            <li><strong>E</strong>xpress</li>
            <li><strong>A</strong>ssert</li>
            <li><strong>R</strong>einforce</li>
            <li><strong>M</strong>indful</li>
            <li><strong>A</strong>ppear Confident</li>
            <li><strong>N</strong>egotiate</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These all break down into a script one can follow for more successful interactions. Each part of D.E.A.R. M.A.N. is explained below and used to create a script to practice before an upcoming interaction.</p>

            <form>
                <h4>D.E.A.R. M.A.N. can be used to either ask for something, or to say no to something. To adjust the examples used below, choose the proper option for your situation below:</h4>

                <select>
                    <option value="yes">Asking for something</option>
                    <option value="no">Saying no to something</option>
                </select>
            </form>

            <form>
                <h4>Enter in the overarching topic of the conversation:</h4>
                <input type="text" placeholder="Topic">
            </form>
        </article>

        <section class="describe-section">

            <h2>Describe</h2>
            <p>The first step is to describe the problem only using facts. It is important to be specific and clear in describing the topic. This step may not be necessary if the situation has already been described (i.e. if you are saying no to a request that was just asked).</p>

            <p class="ask-example"></p>
            <p class="no-example"></p>

            <form>
                <h4>Describe the situation, remembering to only stick to the facts:</h4>
                <textarea></textarea>
            </form>

        </section>

        <section class="express-section">

            <h2>Express</h2>
            <p>In this step, you tell the other party how you feel. It is advised to use "I" statements (I feel like ____) during this step. Again, be as specific as possible here and do not assume the other party knows or should know how you feel. </p>

            <p class="ask-example"></p>
            <p class="no-example"></p>

            <form>
                <h4>Describe your feelings and opinions about the situation, trying to use I statements as much as possible</h4>
                <textarea></textarea>
            </form>

        </section>

        <section class="assert-section">

            <h2>Assert</h2>
            <p>At this point, clearly ask for what you want or say no. Be specific when giving instructions in this step.</p>

            <p class="ask-example"></p>
            <p class="no-example"></p>

            <form>
                <h4>Enter your assertion below, being as clear as possible in how it can be followed</h4>
                <textarea></textarea>
            </form>

        </section>

        <section class="reinforce-section">

            <h2>Reinforce</h2>
            <p>Now, give positive reinforcement in regards to your request. Explain why honoring the request would lead to positive outcomes.</p>
            
            <p class="ask-example"></p>
            <p class="no-example"></p>

            <form>
                <h4>List at least one positive outcome from your goal</h4>
                <input type="text" placeholder="A positive outcome">
            </form>

        </section>

        <section class="mindful-section">

            <h2>Stay Mindful</h2>
            <p>It is important during the conversation to stay on track. If the other party responds with agression or defensivness, do not engage with it. Rather, continue stating your request or no like a broken record. Getting off topic will reduce the likelyhood of your goal being met.</p>

            <p class="ask-example"></p>
            <p class="no-example"></p>

        </section>

        <section class="confident-section">
            <h2>Appear Confident</h2>
            <p>During the conversation, keep a strong posture (stand/sit tall), a strong tone, and keep stammering and uncertainty to a minimum. This makes it more likely for the other party to take your request seriously, and it makes you harder to turn down.</p>

            <p class="ask-example"></p>
            <p class="no-example"></p>

            <form>
                <h4>What is an area to be mindful of during conversation to appear confident?</h4>
                <input type="text">
            </form>
        </section>

        <section class="negotiate-section">

            <h2>Negotiate</h2>
            <p>In some cases, it is important to give a little to get a little. If the other party isn't in agreeance with your request or no, it can be useful to try to find an alternate solution to the issue that aligns with your goals. You could eventually ask the other party to offer a solution that would work. Negotiation can also serve to make future interactions with the other party easier.</p>

            <p class="ask-example"></p>
            <p class="no-example"></p>

            <form>
                <h4>What are some ways your request can be adjusted to make room for the other party?</h4>
                <input type="text" placeholder="One adjustment">
                <input type="text" placeholder="Another adjustment">
