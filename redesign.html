            <section id="describe">
                <h3>Describe</h3>

                <p class="info">The first step in the process is to describe the situation using only facts. It is important to be clear and specific while describing the topic. This step may be skipped if the situation is already clearly layed out, such as when saying no to something just asked.</p>

                <p class="ask-example"></p>

            <section id="express">
                <h3>Express</h3>

                <p class="info">The next step is to express your feelings/opinions on the situation. Use "I" statements during this step, while avoiding the use of "you" if possible. It is again important to be as clear and specific as possible as to leave no confusion. It should not be assumed that the other party knows or should know your feelings.</p>

                <p class="ask-example"></p>

                <p class="no-example"></p>

            <section id="assert">
                <h3>Assert</h3>

                <p class="info">This is the step when you either ask what you want or say no. Again, be specific when providing instructions for honoring your request.</p>

                <p class="ask-example"></p>

                <p class="no-example"></p>

                <section class="form-inputs">
                    <label for="assertion">Enter your assertion below, being as clear as possible in how it can be followed:</label>

            </section>

            <section id="reinforce">
                <h3>Reinforce</h3>

                <p class="info">In this step, provide the other party with the positive outcomes of honoring your request. If necessary, you can also include the negative outcomes of not honoring the request. Also, give reinforcement after the other party does follow your request. This can be as simple as a "thank you".</p>

                <p class="ask-example"></p>

                <p class="no-example"></p>

            <section id="stay-mindful">
                <h3>Stay Mindful</h3>

                <p class="info">The next two parts are things to keep in mind during the conversation. During the conversation, it is important to stay on topic. Getting off topic can significantly reduce the chance of meeting your goal. If the other party responds with defensiveness or agression, it is important to not engage with it. A strategy for this is to repeat your assertion over and over again, like a broken record.</p>

                <p class="ask-example"></p>

                <p class="no-example"></p>

            <section id="appear-confident">
                <h3>Appear Confident</h3>

                <p class="info">During the conversation, you should try to appear confident. This will make the other party take you more seriously and increase the likelyhood your request is met. This step says to "appear" confident, rather than be confident. This can be achieved by having a strong posture (sit/stand striaght), having a strong tone, and keeping a clear voice (trying not to stammer).</p>

                <p class="ask-example"></p>

                <p class="no-example"></p>

            <section id="negotiate">
                <h3>Negotiate</h3>

                <p class="info">It is important to remember that you are making a request. If the other party isn't completely on board, it may be required to move your request to accomodate with the other party. During this step, it is important to keep your overall goal in mind. Work with the other person to find a solution that both of you are comfortable with. You could go as far to ask the other party what a good solution would be. Negotiation can also make future interactions with the other party better in the future, as negotiation makes you look like a reasonable person.</p>
